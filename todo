MS: some thoughts for improvements; should also mine bloglines, newsgator and yahoo (et. al) for more ideas

version 0.9.8
 - change sort date to "Today", "Yesterday", "x days ago"
 - html for aggregator description
version 0.9.9
 - notifications (convert multiple rss feeds to email. cool?!?)
version 1
 - add to del.ici.us button?
 - pagination for display? or another means of tidying up display page (anchors between feeds?)
 - style items (both w and w/o description) entirely via css
version 1.2
 - search
 - per subscription keywords
version 1.2+
 - edit subscription title
 - separate css with per package param for location
