MS: some thoughts for improvements; should also mine bloglines, newsgator and yahoo, etc. for more ideas

version 1.1
 - make source::update more robust; an error in one feed shouldn't affect the updating of others (done, need QA)
 - fix portlet
 - parameterize the query limit for items (hard coded to 600)
  - ok, this is actually handled on index page with parameter but we should only get what we want to display
 - code cleanup and complete tests
version 1.2
 - update data model for 5.2
 - richtext widget for aggregator description?
 - add to del.ici.us button?
 - edit subscription title
version 1.3
 - notifications (convert multiple rss feeds to email. cool?!?)
 - rework index page query to convert time in DB (sort is by date, source, time)
version 1.4
 - search
version 1.4+
 - DeleteAfterFailCount parameter so that we can automatically remove a feed that's broken (if admin wishes)
 - per subscription keywords
 - other display options?
